# Overview

Personal re-implementations of Machine Learning papers. Re-implementations might use different hyper-parameters / datasets / settings compared to the original paper.

Current re-implementations include:

# Contributing
While this repo is a personal attempt to familiarize with the ideas down to the nitty gritty details, contributions are welcome for re-implementations that are already on the repository. In particular, I am open to discuss doubts, questions, suggestions to improve the code, and spotted mistakes / bugs. If you would like to contribute, simply raise an issue before submitting a pull request.
